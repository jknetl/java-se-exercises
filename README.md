# Java SE exercises

This project contains set of simple java exercises. These exercises are ment to test and enhance your knowledge of Java SE basic features.

The repository is divided into multiple modules. Modules structure maintains same structure as [Java SE tutorial trail](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).

Each module contains its own readme file which contains:

* link to specific Java SE trail which is covered by the module
* list of Java SE features which are exercised in the module
* list of exercises description

## Solutions

The repository comes with solution to the exercises. They may be multiple possible solutions.
I tried to follow concepts presented in respective Java Tutorial trail in order to implement solutions.
I specifically tried to avoid any third party libraries in order to write solution.

If you have any improvments using standard Java SE I will appreciate if you report an issue or provide a pull request with enhancements.
